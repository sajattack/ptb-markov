Don't give me a confession, some cop films that shit!
Please leave me alone on the couch on the weekend!
There is no telling why that in the class there's yelling
Guess there aren't enough people, I guessed everything

It's so simple to see through my complexities
Freakin’ stoned pissed and broke small town anarchy!
So productive all this lazy enjoyment
I can admit I can't give a shit for employment!

I got nothing goin' for me
He sings along gives affection as we be
And breaks down and watches from between
If you happen to ask he'll just wanna sit on his ass
Sip backing, sleep out in the grass!

It's so simple to see through my complexities
Freakin’ stoned pissed and broke small town anarchy!
So productive all this lazy enjoyment
I can admit I can't give a shit for employment!
Fuck the work ethic!

Life's a joke that you don't get 'til you're dead
But the Punchline isn't funny even then
So I put my faith in nothing and haven't been let down yet
Smiling alone, in the rain soaking wet

Love's a made for TV movie that's lame method acting
But my audition sucked so I wasn't casted!
Instead I watch the 'friends' re-run and call it social life!
My most meaningful personal relationship happens 8 o'clock, NBC, every Thursday night

But I don't care about that now, 'cause I'm fucking drunk! (Fucking drunk!)
I don't care about life, I'm happy fucking up! (Fucking up!)
I don't care about you now, 'cause I hate everyone! (Everyone!)
Don't need no justification, just gimme the fucking gun!

So you think I got an evil mind?
Well I'm telling you, honey
That I don't know why
No, I don't know why
So you think my singing's out of time?
Well it makes me money
But I don't know why
No, I don't know why
Anymore

So come on, feel the noise
Girls, rock your boys
We're getting wild, wild, wild
We're getting wild, wild, wild

So you think I got a funny face?
Well I got no worries
But I don't know why
No, I don't know why
So you think I'm some kind of disgrace?
Well I'm in no hurry
But I don't know why
No, I don't know why
Anymore

So come on, feel the noise
Girls, rock your boys
We're getting wild, wild, wild
We're getting wild, wild, wild
Come on, feel the noise
Girls, rock your boys
We're getting wild, wild, wild, wild, wild, wild wild wild wild

One thing I've learned is I don't need no one
Got my social issues, not sure where they come from
But me and loneliness, yeah, we make best friends
We'll be together up until the end, yeah

You give me nothing to do, I wanna kill an interest
Pass the gallon of Coke, yeah, I could live like this

Don't have to worry about sleep deprivation problems
Just chug that shit down and it'll solve 'em
Love Coca-Cola 'cause now I'm wired
Let's grab some lighters and set some buildings on fire

You give me nothing to do, I wanna kill an interest
Pass the gallon of Coke, yeah, I could live like this

Life is just a series of dormant fractions
Stock my friends down if I'm not just slackin'
Fuck the work ethic, don't watch your discipline
Let it all go to shit, fun-loving nihilism

You give me nothing to do, I wanna kill an interest
Pass the gallon of Coke, yeah, I could live like this


Just give me nothing to do, I wanna kill an interest
Pass the gallon of Coke, yeah, I could live like this

Dalia never showed me nothing but kindness
She would say: “I know how sad you get"
And some days, I still get that way
But it gets better, it gets better, it gets better
Sweetie, it gets better, I promise you
And she'd tell me...

Your heart is a muscle the size of your fist
Keep on loving, keep on fighting
And hold on, and hold on
Hold on for your life

Ian built a cabin in the woods to live in
For years, terrifying noises kept him up at night
With a twelve gauge under his pillow
He’s living in Boston now, going to art school
I forgive him, I forgive him
Hell, I’ll admit it: I’m proud of him

Serena’s an architect and a carpenter
She’s such a feminist she says she isn’t one
'Cause, "Goddamn, my gender shouldn’t matter!"
And her motorcycle glides through the streets of Providence
Down to the warehouse district, the paint job is as stunning as
Her knowledge of medieval building techniques

Your heart is a muscle the size of your fist
Keep on loving, keep on fighting
And hold on, and hold on
Hold on for your life

This one goes out to Georgios, he knows how to dance
Abby Banks, your book is beautiful
And fuck anyone who says otherwise
Scott, I love you and you make me glad to be alive
I promise that I’m gonna pay you back
You always know how funny everything is
Even when I’m so serious that it’s gonna be the death of me

Like the time that our friend Chuck came over to our house
He said he needed somebody to take care of his pets
'Cause he was going out of town
I asked him, “Where,” and he said “New Mexico”
I asked if I could get a ride
He said: “No, you don’t want to follow me
Where it is I’m going”
He backed out of the driveway
That was the last time we saw him
'Cause he drove straight to his parent’s cabin
And put a bullet in his head

Your heart is a muscle the size of your fist
Keep on loving, keep on fighting
And hold on, and hold on
Hold on for your life...

Your heart is a muscle the size of your fist
Keep on loving, keep on fighting
And hold on, and hold on
Hold on for your life

I'm not a good person
Ask anyone who knows me
I'm mean and bitter
And a failure at everything that I say I believe

I'm not a good person
Ask anyone who loves me
I never write, I never call
I never think about anyone at all

I'm not a good person
No matter what I do
My exhaustion will consume me
And I'm too tired for the truth

I'm not a good person
I'm sure you're not surprised
It must be pouring out my sweat glands
It must be someplace in my eyes

I don't know why I am this way
I've been like this since I can remember
I try to keep up with everything I know I should do
But then I'll fall to pieces anyway

I don't know why I am this way
I'm not a good person, not even to you
I'm staying home because I can't stand the sound
Of another heartbeat in the room

I'm not a good person
Fuck it, you know it's true
I'm lazy, I'm a coward
I'm asleep all day in my room

I don't know why I am this way
I've been like this since I can remember
I try to keep up with everything I know I should do
But then I'll fall to pieces anyway

Well, I’m afraid that the circles I’ve been drinking myself in
Aren’t big enough for the vowels that
I try to fit inside of them
When I was young, I drank too much, and I’d be lying if I said
I didn’t feel so goddamn young tonight
Maybe too young to ask what’s on my mind
Like if freedom means doing what I want
Well, don’t I gotta want something?
And won’t you tell me that we want something more than just more beer?
And my friends, if that ain’t true, won’t you lie to me tonight? (oh yeah)

Well, I’ve been listening to Minor Threat records all day
And shit if I do not know every word
I sing along as I tie off
And Ian screams he’s “Out of Step”
As I throw the cotton into the spoon, draw up into the syringe
I’ll know just what he means until I hit a vein
But after that I won’t have to bother with knowing who I am
For a while at least
In a moment the whole world is gonna melt around me
And I’ll swear I don’t miss it as a I lie to you tonight

Because I’m afraid to look the world in the eye
If nothing’s gonna change, well, then I’d rather die
And I’m too unemployed to organize a union
I’m too intoxicated to tear down a building
I’m too hopeless to look for a solution, I’m afraid that if I found one
I’d be out of excuses for the way
I waste away in the gutters that I chose
Like fashion accessories to go with my dirty clothes
I haven’t bathed in months, but you know it’s not because
I’ve been fighting bourgeois morals, I’m just lazy and I’m young

I’ve seen the best minds of my generation
Dying drunk or high from the rooftops to the parking lots
Stomped to death in west Philadelphian squats
They’ve got me waiting on a day when we can say “fuck the police!”
With a little bit of integrity
When it will mean: “I’ve got your back if you’ve got mine!”
Give me a scene where I believe in more
Than bad hair cuts, guilt, and misery
I don’t know where I fit between the vegans and the nihilists
That might be the first thing I’ve said that wasn’t a lie tonight

Because there’s gotta be something more
Than lying in the front yard, naked, screaming at the constellations
I want something more than an apology to say
When I look the world in the eye
I’ll tell you, man, my friend William came to me with a message of hope
It went: “Fuck you and everything that you think you know
If you don’t step outside the things that you believe
They’re gonna kill you.”
He said: “You think no one’s gonna stop you from dying young and miserable? You're right!
If you want something better, you gotta put that shit aside.”

I thought about how for thousands of years
There have been people who told us that things can’t go on like this
From Jesus Christ to the Diggers, from Malthus to Zerzan,
From Karl Marx to Huey Newton
But the shit goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on
On and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on
Now, I’m not saying that we can’t change the world
'Cause everybody does at least a little bit of that
But I won’t shit myself, the way I’m living is a temper tantrum and I
Need something else, need something else, need something else to stay alive

And on the night that I play my last show, I’ll be
Singing so loud that my heart explodes
And I’ll be singing, I’ll be singing: 'We are free!'
Oh, but won’t you promise me that we won’t ever
Forget what the means?
I know it’s hard to give a shit sometimes, but promise me we’ll always try
Cause I don’t wanna hate you, and I don’t wanna hate me
And I don’t wanna have to hate everything anymore

I swear that someday
I'll tell you without lying
I was born to quit smoking
I was born to quit dying
On that day
Not doing heroin will be easy as piss
And on that day
I'll stop talkin' so much shit about the government

'Cause urine speaks louder than words
On a politician
Or on a prison warden
Urine speaks louder than words

I swear that today
I was born to be livin'
I was born to be singin'
I was born to be fightin'
But will somebody say
Is this resistance or a costume party
Either way I think black with bandanas is a boring theme

I don't gotta tell you
Crackers are great with amnesia
When they wanna forget something like
Centuries of racism
They say, "Look at the man on center stage
And pay no attention"
While millions get locked in a cage
Riots break out in Oakland

But urine speaks louder than words
On a prison warden
Or on a BART Policeman
Urine speaks louder than words

I swear I'll run away from every home I ever have
So I'll build a new house in every town I pass
Maybe then I won't always feel lost and trapped

When I was growing up, I was the smartest kid I knew
Maybe that was just because I didn't know that many kids
All I know is now I feel the opposite

Like if you don't want to work, then that becomes your job
There's a lot of overtime, there's not many days off
I hope you know that I'm not trying to complain
It just gets hard to explain
To people that I know, or kids who come to shows
That I just don't want to talk about the office today

'Cause I've watched friends go from being pessimists to work at home archaeologists
They dig skin deep, they work hard every day
On burying their arms for a vein or two that maybe they forgot

And the cops say it's a crime
For people like me and those friends of mine to want to die
Like my neighbor in St. Pete
She's been on house arrest down here
If she tries to leave her yard they'll lock her in a cage for years
'Cause sometimes she wants to die
And she shoots dope when she thinks she could die
And the law, they caught her one too many times
Shootin' dope when she felt like she could die

We're building a new world, all of my friends and me
It's not an exact science yet, but we have the technology
Now all we need is an economy
Where everybody finally will get enough to eat
Even the suburbs know power's getting too crooked
To stand on its own feet for much longer than it has

So I don't want to kill a cop
What I want is neighborhoods where they don't have to get called
When the shit goes down
'Cause our friends, they are enough, and our neighbors have enough
Finally we're enough

'Cause our friends, they are enough
And our neighbors are enough
And finally we're enough
Please help me be, please help me be
Please help me be enough

Fuck the law 'cause we're enough
Fuck the boss 'cause we're enough
Fuck Microsoft 'cause we're enough
Fuck owning stocks 'cause we're enough
Fuck you 'cause we're enough
Fuck moving to Brooklyn cause we're enough
Fuck The Clash 'cause we're enough
Fuck Marshall Stacks 'cause we're enough
Quit what you don't love 'cause we're enough
Live as you make it up 'cause we're enough
You'll never go without 'cause we're enough
We'll buy a house 'cause we're enough
We'll grow some food 'cause we're enough
We'll slam some dunks 'cause we're enough
Don't be afraid 'cause we're enough
You'll always be okay because we'll always be enough

The trains roll by my porch
Down here where nothing can live
I’ve been smoking too much because I am no exception
You knew that already, I think

If you want salvation
Then you ought to go see a priest
Because forgiveness from those that we hurt in this world
Never was guaranteed

I’m coming home, it’s late again, I’m high as I’ve ever been
You’re sitting up, you’re in our bed crying for a ghost again
No room could be as dark or as empty as ours is
Because I’m at home but I’m not here, and I never am

I wonder how many
Friends roll past my house in the night?
In boxcars they sleep with hearts stashed in their backpacks
They’ll make California all right

A promise from me
Is just a lie I ain’t told yet
So I’m ready to die, but I’m not willing to watch
You watch me die here in our bed

I’m lying down, I’ve been nodding out since I don’t know when
The lights are on, you’re standing up screaming at a ghost again
Darling, I’m home, hell I ain’t left this house of ours in days
But I’m not here. I never am, so I just can’t stay

My darlin', I’m never comin' back from where I’m going
My darlin', I’m never comin' home
My darlin', I’m never comin' back from where I’m going
My darlin', I’m never comin' home
Never comin' home again

[Verse 1]
As he lights an American Spirit
He asks how I can smoke such shit
I say there's nothing like chain smoking
GPC cigarettes
Because any smokes will kill ya
But these will make you feel like it

I sit back down
On the parking lot curb
And remember back to February
The trip to Hartford

With five minutes to go
He was passed out on the staircase
Trying to walk to his apartment
But not making it all the way

And now he's driving us
100 miles an hour down the interstate
Another beer in his hand
Swearing we won't be late

That was before everyone moved to New Mexico
They all left a couple of months ago
Until the day my friend
When I sleep on the floor of your van again
I'll be waiting in this parking lot

And in my dreams, I am dirty broke, beautiful, and free
My hands clenched in a fist, and my face in a smile, after hitching too many miles

We aren't revolutionaries, but we are the revolution
And sometimes I think that the whole movement is just me and you
And that maybe we'd all be better off if that were true

Because then at least we'd know where we stand
And we could tell our comrades apart from the man

But if the world isn't that simple
Maybe this town is at least
And if I'm not marching with them to war I'm sure not marching with you for peace

Class traitor? What fucking ever!
I'm just another middle class kid, too
But if I'm not good at changing, I'm good at self loathing
So I'll class hate myself with you

May our only occupation be not having a job
May the only cocktails that we make be Molotov

May that day be now
And for as many days after that as we know how
It starts in this parking lot

And in my dreams, I am dirty broke beautiful and free
My hands clenched in a fist and my face in a smile
After hitching too many miles

We're kids building models of a world, that we might wanna live in
And sorting feelings in our stomach--is this liberation or starvation?
But have we made it anywhere at all if the dishes are never done?
If we can't live without dishwashers, how would we live without cops?
And so you're asking me, who does the dishes after the revolution?
Well, I do my own dishes now, I'll do our own dishes then
You know it's always the ones who don't who ask that fucking question

So I don't believe in God, but I'm also not an Atheist
You know the universe is chaos, but chaos plays favorites
And you know lately, I've been thinking about how I love Jesus
Because Jesus was a dirty homeless, hippie peace activist
And he said, "Drop out and find God" to anybody who would listen
While turning water into space bags, turning water into space bags, turning water into space bags with lowlifes and anarchists

I want freedom
Not a boss that comes in a forty ounce bottle of
Anything or taped scotch paper

I eat meat and drive trucks
And shoot guns and don't trust in the
Federal government to solve our problems

You might think I'm joking
But I'm not a Republican

Call me when your president pulls out of Afghanistan
Because that's the day I'll get a cell phone number
And you can call and leave a message on voice mail that day

I fell asleep smoking
So I'd wake up on fire
Because that might get me out of bed for a while
And back into battle with the things that I breathe
And the holes in my arms
And the way that I think

And if freedom is doing what I want
Well that means I gotta know what is
Not just what it isn't
So I'll dig up the dirt
And I'll throw down some seeds
Because the world needs more spinach
Not more motherfuckers like me

Motherfuckers like me!
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-ooohhh-oh!

I woke up thinking:
God is real, but against us
Pray for what you don't want
Reverse theology

I'll pray for freedom
Because no matter how much I say I want it
I'm still getting led around by a cigarette
Or anger or fear

Take your pick
I don't give a shit
And I wish it weren't true
But to get free we have to start with what's true I think

And if I have to tell you that what's real is terrible
Maybe you're in the wrong place
If I have to tell you that what's true is terrible
Maybe you're in the wrong place

Because I've done horrible things to wonderful people
I've let horrible people stay living
I've looked my family in the eye and told them:
"Leave me to die, or I'll make you sorry you didn't."

I've stolen from people who didn't deserve it
I've not helped people who did
I've turned away when I knew I made a mistake
Instead of dealing with it

I've wasted good chances I've had in this life
That other people won't even get
I put off setting things right with Andy
And now he's dead

But if we can stay one inch this side of dying
The most terrible things we can imagine can happen
And our breath will carry us forward
When we don't have the strength to carry ourselves

And we'll get another chance at not spreading misery
At least for today

And If I have to tell you that we are beautiful
Maybe you're in the right place
And If I ever forget that we are beautiful
I hope you're here to remind me
If I have to tell you that we are beautiful
I hope you'll stick around until you can see it

I was stupid enough to throw my life away on music
Like it was that simple
But if singing changed anything
They'd make it illegal
I hate strangers, loud noises, and crowds
I'll play a show every night

And would you, and would you believe
There are people who come to me for advice?
I'm driving fast as the car can go
Because I'm going home

I was desperate enough for the feeling
Of pushing back to jump into the streets
The cops have us all surrounded;
Hear them gnashing their teeth
Ready now, bail down the alley when we hit the next light

And would you, and would you believe
There are people who ask me how to fight?
I'm running fast as these legs can go
And I'm going home

Five years ago
I was broken enough to just shut the fuck up
I got sober by going to rehab
And not arguing so much for once
Punk rockers ask me how I did it
Hoping for an easier way

And would you, and would you believe
That they don't like what I have to say?
I pray as much as an atheist can
And then I walk home
I'm going fast as the car can go
Because I'm going home

I don't believe in cops, bosses, or politicians
Some call that anarchism. I call it
Having a fucking heart that beats!

I do believe in freedom and never giving up
Call my methods madness or call it a bluff
I do what I got to to be able to breathe!
And If you quit your job well, you can do a little breathing with me

A punk rock song won't ever change the world
But I can tell you about a couple that changed me
So, tonight, we're gonna fuck shit up!
Tonight, we're gonna fuck shit up!
Tonight, we're gonna fuck shit up!

A punk rock song won't ever change the world!
But I can tell you about a couple that changed me!
So, tonight, we're gonna fuck shit up!
Tonight, we're gonna fuck shit up!
Tonight, we're gonna fuck shit up!

This car is a war machine that runs on nicotine and gasoline
D-d-d-don't you fucking know this is the wrong side of the road?

Who needs brakes when it's all downhill from here?
And if we ain't died yet then, just maybe we never will

But I don't wanna burn out, so won't you please set me on fire again? I woke up afraid of losing everything; thank god that I already have
So if you love me then listen: mind your own fucking business! If you love me enough to stay, then please love me enough to stay...enough to stay away

I swear on my last cigarette that i'd love you my d-d-darling. I'd love you if I could
But since the day I was born, it's been too late for me to be anything but what I am tonight...
And what I am is drunk, and what I am is mean, in your passenger seat!
Seat belts are for people who have time to die; hell, I don't even have time to sleep

Because I don't wanna miss a moment of loathing everything that I see
I stay up nights afraid of everything, till all that's left is the shadows and me
Ask me from sunrise to sunset: no, I ain't left the house yet
I finally love you enough to stay...enough to stay away!

Aw, shit, I wish I had a job to quit
I wish I had a boss that I could tell to fuck off
Give me the satisfaction of a dramatic exit
And not just a long car ride and a short goodbye in a parking lot (Oh oh oh)

I was a loner until there were no friends left
And before someone offered me drugs
You know, I was straight edge
And everyone's quit 'til you offer them a cigarette
Before we learn our lesson
Lets see how bad things can get

And I'll drink myself to death
Or at least, I'll drink myself to sleep
Chain smoke my way through the gaps in between
My aspirations and my apathy

As we drive past the last exit to home I am waving goodbye
And I might be sleeping in the ditch tonight
But it's alright, 'cause whiskey is my kind of lullaby

I was sober all morning 'til I woke up this afternoon
And before someone offered me a job, you know I was gonna get one soon
And everyone in this town sleeps 'til the calendar collides with June
Before the booze wears off, let's take another shot or two

And I'll drink myself to death
Or at least, I'll drink myself to sleep
Chain smoke my way through the gaps in between
My aspirations and my apathy

As we drive past the last exit to home I am waving goodbye
And I might be sleeping in the ditch tonight
But it's alright, 'cause whiskey is my kind of lullaby

I stick tape in the holes in my shoes
I stick my tongue in the holes in my teeth
I stick expletives in the holes in my thought
Process when I speak
My friends stick to their guns
They got a bunch in the woods of Vermont
'Till the end times come
But Saturn, says he's gonna learn to live
As if the world wasn't gonna end and I admire his strength

So today I'm gonna do my best
To drink coffee in the morning and live as if
I didn't feel lonely and hopeless and helpless
To save myself for the world where I live
And tonight, when I dream it will be
That the junkies spent all the drug money on
Community gardens and collective housing
And the punk kids who moved in the ghetto
Have started meeting their neighbors besides the angry ones
With the yards, that their friends and their dogs have been puking and shitting on
And the anarchists have started
Filling potholes, collecting garbage
To prove we don't need governments to do these things
And I'll wake up, burning Time's Square as we sing
"Throw your hands in the air 'cause property is robbery!"

He talks about nothing using too many words
He talks revolution for an hour without using any verbs
She acts her age which is most of her problem
In love with everyone until she wakes up tomorrow

Another Saturday night
Another fucking shitty Saturday night

I'm spinning in the next room
Slurring along to my isolation
At the top of my lungs
I'm sitting here next to you
Sore throat from jokes about all the dumbest things I've done
I don't want to be anywhere at all
Here or at my house kicking at the wall

If home is where the heart is
Then I live in my upper chest
I'm gonna drink until these tears
Start to taste like the cheap beer
I'm gonna drink tonight until these tears
Start to taste like the cheap beer

The bottles are stacked like they show how we're different
And that maybe if we were sober we could explain what this all meant
But pints of Vodka don't write poetry
You can't rearrange crushed pills into melodies

But I swear to fuck;
That a brick through a broken Starbucks window means more
And I swear to fuck;
That we fight more systems when we're passed out on the floor
Than the words of Kropotkin ever could
And all the works of Karl Marx ever fucking could

I'm puking in the next room
Sorry about the carpet
Clean it up or your mom'll be mad
I'm pretending that I'm too good for you
So you can't see the worthless pathetic person I am

Better to seem like an asshole
Than what you are
The billionth teenage boy with social problems
Who plays the guitar

I'm not sure what I want you to say to me
But I know the look on your face that I want to see

If home is where the heart is
Then mine is a cigarette
I'm gonna drink until these tears
Start to taste like the cheap beer
I'm gonna drink tonight until these tears
Start to taste like the cheap beer

I'm not you and that's good enough for me
The only word that I use is fuck
So you can forget the dictionary

I can't tell what question you're asking
I don't care 'cause no is my answer

Another Saturday night
Against everything on a Saturday night

I'm bleeding in the next room
Let it happen 'cause maybe the blood-loss will add to my high
I'm here beating up on you
'cause I'm just drunk enough to be sure that I'm ready to die

I don't care that you don't care that I don't care
The only card game I know is strip solitaire

If home is where the heart is
Then I got evicted this week
I'm gonna drink until these tears
Start to taste like the cheap beer
I'm gonna drink tonight until these tears
Start to taste like the cheap beer

Malcolm X never lived to see the government fall
But the state he opposed made him a stamp
Maybe that's the best you can hope for if you never give up:
Your enemies will teach your corpse to dance

And you and me, buddy
We've been living for a ghost when we ain't been sticking our heads in the sand
So when I'm afraid take me by the hand
And show the world that we can't be planned

It's alright, it's okay
It's just that everything's fucked
It's alright, it's okay
It's just that everything's fucked

Catch me smashing my own windows
When I'm feeling nuts
It's alright, it's okay
It's just that everything's fucked

I've been lying on the floor
Alone and unwashed, without enough courage to brush my teeth
I'm afraid of the red that will pour out my gums
And bleed me to death in my sleep

I've been staying inside with the curtains down
Ignoring what phone calls I get
So when I come out take me by the hand and show the world a fight it won't forget

It's alright, it's okay
It's just that everything's fucked
It's alright, it's okay
It's just that everything's fucked
It's alright, it's okay
It's just that everything's fucked
It's alright, it's okay
It's just that everything's fucked
It's alright, it's okay
It's just that everything's fucked
It's alright, it's okay
It's just that everything's fucked

Catch me smashing my own windows
When I'm feeling nuts
It's alright, it's okay
It's just that everything's fucked

I'm growing old in rooms
Full of kids with unruly hair cuts
Taking what comfort we can
In the fact that "every empire's days are numbered, man"

But I don't think that I can count that high
I should have paid better attention in school or something
Because I feel like there's something that I don't know
And if I could just jam it into my skull
I could stand to live somehow

But I don't know
And the fact is I'm 2.7 decades into a growing ambivalence
I could count on no hands how many fucks I'm giving
Or is it a million? Are "god" and "void" equivalent?
Are we making total destroy
Or just making a living?

And I know that Rome wasn't burnt in a day
But it couldn't have been more than a week
And I know that the children of barbarians
Become the new tax collectors and priests
So I don't know

I suppose we've been rolling since the world was round
And time makes dust of what we can't tear down
And I suppose dead bodies make soil of the ground
But what about what we do now?

I'm growing old in rooms
Full of kids with unruly hair cuts
Taking what comfort we can
In the fact that "every empire's days are numbered, man"

But I don't think that I can count that high

So I dip this pen in arsenic
I write a song for every president
That won't ever get shot in the face

I wrap these strings in plastic explosives
Head down to the court house
With one chord I level the place

But hasn't anybody learned
Don't ever trust a man who plays guitar
The day I rob a bank's the first day I'm not lying
To you or me about what I believe

If I die then let my gravestone read
"Rest in P-Funk"
'Cause no pulse is no excuse not to dance
If I live then let my heart be
Like a beating picket line
They'll sooner see a corpse than see a scab

Hasn't anybody learned
The last who make the moves
Are the first to say the words
The day I rob a bank's the first day of my life
As an honest man, an honest man
The day I rob a bank's the first day of my life
As an honest man, an honest man
The day I go to jail trying to rob a bank's
The day I finally get what I deserve


I spent my life drifting
To things that fall apart as soon as it gets hard
We live without leaders, but now there's nobody to steer
Captains go down with the ship, my friend, but there's no captains here

There's no petition we can sign to end poverty
Or to make "no" a word with teeth
I know there's not enough windows on this planet to break us free
But maybe one will be just enough for some dignity

Just do the dirt and walk away and don't say shit
My momma didn't raise no snitch
If anybody asks, well then I've never heard your name
No rest for the wicked till we've crossed the state

And common decency may lead us through a prison cell
Basic goodness take us to hell
But since we'll all return to dirt
Let's bring some stories for the worms

We don't know when
But the days will come again when their courts can't hold us in
We'll stand our ground no matter how many police appear
Captains go down with the ship, my friend, and we're all captains here
And just for a moment, we were all captains then


I don’t believe in heaven
I do believe in hell
It’s down the street from here, we both lived there for years
We burned the calendars for warmth, and the alarm clocks just for fun
We closed the blinds and made goddamn sure that we could never see the sun
You could set a watch by the bottle returns and the ashtrays overflowing on the floor
Nothing’s free but time when you’re so damn poor
But the past was death row, and the future’s a battlefield
I hope we choose the right war
Cause I’ve been fist fighting gravity since the day I learned how to breathe
I still wake up on the same cold floor I fell asleep on

So I won’t, but we shall overcome someday
I can’t do it alone, but I shall be free someday
I don’t know how to live, but I’m sick of learning how to die
Vampirism is for poseurs in junior high

We made our own postal system across the continent
As long as freight trains run and loners pick up dreamers with thumbs, who needs governments
To get a letter to you, or a mixtape to me, or a postcard to Johnstown?
What’s a thousand miles between friends? What’s a friend that’s not worth crossing a country?
But I owe money and broken hearts from Philly to Sydney and back to Vermont
I regret a million things and that’s only what I haven’t forgot
But the past was a mine field, and right now is a prison break
I hope we make it alive
When who we are doesn’t stop where the law begins
Then we’ll storm their court houses to survive

So I won’t, but we shall overcome someday
I can’t do it alone, but we shall be free someday
I don’t know how to live, but I’m sick of learning how to die
Vampirism is for poseurs in junior high

And if we decide that freedom is impossible then we'll prove ourselves right!
But if that is the truth, well then
I think that there is worse things in this world than being wrong!
And I suppose you gotta be a little crazy to believe
That we shall be free, but I'm insane!
And I'm not alone!
No, I'm not alone! No, no, no, no, no, I'm not alone!
Unless it's just the punk rock show talking to me
Sing along the words that you can't hear over the sound of your friends
Over the sound of the kegs, over the sound of the beer!
The painted doors they treat this house like anarchy could work
But you aren't ready yet!
And you aren't alone!
And you aren't alone, No, no, no, no, no, you aren't alone!

And I'm not sure that we are what we eat
But I'm pretty sure we smell like what we do
So I might smell like trash when I've been taking it out
What's your excuse?
What's your excuse?
I fell in love again that time that you said
"Fuck every cop who ever did his job!
And fuck every bank that never got robbed!
And fuck all the other banks, especially mine."
I know that you've been dealing with that awful feeling
That we're running out of time. And so have I
But we aren't alone!
No, we aren't alone! No, no, no, no, no, we aren't alone!

This one's for every drug problem that got stopped in its tracks
By a trip to rehab
I'll miss railing pills with you in the park
This one's for every friend who decided not to drop out
And stay at their mom's house
I'll miss you on the street corner when it starts to get dark

Because tonight I'm cryin' about the crack house that got torn down
In the center of town
And tonight I'm laughin' about the army recruitment station lying vacant

Here's to the rubble
A brick through every window
A casket buried six feet deep for everybody's hero
Here's to our lives being meaningless
And how beautiful it is because freedom doesn't have a purpose

This one's for every arsonist that got locked down
Before they burnt the cities down
I'll miss seeing the sky scrapers on fire!
This one's for every friend who got taken off the streets
So the upper class could sleep
So the upper class could sleep
I'll miss the spraypaint and slashed tires

Because tonight I can smell the pigs around the corner
On the shortness of your breath
And tonight I can taste the whiskey from across the room
In the stumbling of your steps

Here's to the rubble
A brick through every window
A casket buried six feet deep for everybody's hero
Here's to our lives being meaningless
And how beautiful it is
Because freedom doesn't have a purpose

No one needs to tell me how to get get get down
But won't somebody show me how to get back up?
I thought about killin' my landlord, but he was pretty nice
Instead, I paid my rent on time as often as I could
I've been making strange friends in the desert (Yeah)
They love Jesus and America too
It ain't as bad as it sounds; someday I'll explain it to you

It's not that I mind sleeping alone in the grass
It's just that I've been dreaming since, well, maybe I ain't woke up yet
But nothin's been quite the same since you shot yourself
I don't know if you believe in ghosts; I hope you'd haunt me if you were one
I've been trying not to steal from everybody I know, but so far that's impossible
But here in the desert, somehow I hope that someday it won't be that way for me
No it won't... be that way for me, anymore

I was born a bitter old man
Who got his heart broken in Catalonia, 1936
Things haven’t felt right since
I gave up on life before I arrived
I knew this place wasn’t safe for anyone
But fascists and republicans and their apologists

But I swear to god, I’m gonna die
Full of naive optimism;
A teenager’s heartbreaking conviction that
Things can be different, oh yeah
Things are gonna be real different when we’re finished 'round here

I always wanted to die young
I always wanted to die young
I always wanted to die young
Now I feel younger every day
And i just hope I die younger than I am

I can hear you from a dozen states away
Shivering through a dope sick morning of
No money left and nothing else to steal
Lord only knows that I’ve had my share
Cause there were years when I was ready to die
But it’s only been recently that I’ve been willing to live

And I swear to god, I didn’t plan
For things to end up this way
I had a teenager’s conviction that
I would be different, oh yeah
I was gonna be real different than the person I became

I always wanted to die young
I always wanted to die young
I always wanted to die young
Now I feel younger every day
And i just hope I die younger than I am

But now living’s a struggle
Except when it isn’t, yeah
I woke up this morning and
I wasn’t in prison
But I can’t promise that I’m far from it
I’d still kill a man for cigarette
But with friends like you, who needs homicide?

So this song goes out to all our homies locked down
Come on back now, we need you around
That judge, he doesn’t know what he’s done
No, judges never know the things they do
How could they?

And for once, the whole truth was clear:
Everything's new and there's no turning back
So I'll seek no comfort and shelter no fear
Where they plant orchards I'll reap barren land

Egalitarians with empty hands:
Is it justice to split up the dust?
We are damned and we'll never earn bread
So we shall steal everything that we must

Show me peace and I'll run from that hell
I'll head up the mountain and never come back
Show me utopia--I'll call it a jail
We'll pick up the pieces to snap them in half

We're egalitarians with empty hands
Is it justice, dividing the sand?
We are damned, and we'll never earn trust
And so we'll betray everything that we can

And so we'll betray everything that we can
And so we'll betray everything that we must


We're up all night dreaming
We aren't alive as long as there's a prison guard still breathing
So we're up all night scheming
We don't get tired, we get even

I can't sleep anyway. Wolves haunt my living room
And keep me up all night howling at the moon
I'd still be on the outside of the world we dream of building
But that could never change. Any four walls are a prison to me

We're up all night dreaming
We aren't alive as long as there's a prison guard still breathing
So we're up all night scheming
We don't get tired, we get even

We might ride together until we reach freedom
We might ride till we reach justice
Then I'll get out alone
And walk till all the world is dust

I'll still be on my own
In the community we're building
But that could never change
Any society is prison to me

So I'm up all night dreaming
I'm not alive as long as there's a prison guard that's breathing
So I'm up all night scheming
I don't get tired, I get even
We don't get tired, we get even

I got Arizona residency one day too late
To vote on this election day
Every year before I've been too drunk to register
Then I'd say, "I don't believe in it anyway"
I still shake my head at ballots cast for elephants
And shake my head at ballots cast for donkeys
Because I swear to god our leaders will be death of us
There's no ballot we can cast to set us free
But there's no brick we can throw that will end poverty
And we can't blow up SB1070
Things will never be as simple as when I was twelve years old
Reading Karl Marx in my bedroom alone
Since there have been laws, there have been criminals
There have been thieves since there's been property
And the way will come again when none of those things are around
I just hope it's before people go extinct
So vote November 2nd if it seems right to you
Or don't vote if you think it just holds us down
Just tell me what we're gonna do on November 3rd
To make sure there's no government left to elect two years from now
Just tell me what we're gonna do on November 3rd
To make sure there's no government left to elect two years from now

It was back in community college
It must have been a writing class
And he said something about
How we need the cops to protect us
And I snapped

"Protect us,"
Like the night when you got kidnapped by the pigs
They tore up the house on their way out
So when Scott got home
He'd worry you got taken by somebody worse

I played the show that night
Although my blood was fire in my mouth
Until he walked into the room--still free
At least for now

And we were young once
And sang songs about not giving a fuck
Acting like we had some guts
Well, how about now?

It was at a show someplace
Really, it could have been almost anywhere
Someone kept yelling to stop playing politics
Cause no one care's
And it's a game

Like the time the U.S. marshals came for you
Before the sun was up
Guns drawn for breakfast
"Open up this door before we kick it down."

And we were young once
And sang songs about not giving a fuck
Acting like we had some guts
Well, how about now?
And we were young once
And sang songs about not giving a fuck
Acting like we had some guts
Well, how about now?
How about now?
How about now?

I lay down an awful wreck
Pissing out my window and smoking in bed
The good don't die young, they just haven't had time to
Fuck up the same as the rest of us yet
I want nothing, nothing at all
I'd be driving drunk if I still got drunk
Rev the ignition, straight on to oblivion
Into a void as pure as they come
But if we aren't dead yet, then let's not live as ghosts
If we aren't in jail, then we can leave the house
I'll show you that there's reason to hope in
The spray paint that's all over downtown

Let's fill up our shopping carts with the things we need
And just roll out the front door
Past the cashiers and security guards
But the magnets trip the wheel locks
Before we even clear the parking lot
And take off running through the neighbor's yard

I lay down an awful wreck
Mumbling to myself about the government again
Maybe postmodernism's just an extended tantrum
About how we don't have our flying cars yet
I want nothing, nothing from them
I'd smash every machine if I didn't have one
Rev the ignition, straight onto oblivion
Into a void as pure as they come
But if we aren't dead yet, then let's not live as ghosts
If we aren't in jail, then we can leave the house
I'll show you that there's reason to hope in
The spray paint that's all over downtown

Meet me at the diner at six o' clock on every Wednesday night
And we'll get some coffee and pie
And I'll smile, tip the waiter
Get a ride home: "Thanks for the favor."
And hope that that's enough to build a life

Came to this world a loaded handgun, firing at random
Hit the people who were closest
Not the ones who deserved it
And some of them still don't talk to me
Can't say I blame them for a second
I'll try to aim more carefully
But it's too late for that, I reckon
But not too late for regret

I'll walk barefoot and smoke inside any chance I get
But in the mean time: come on
Let's go for a ride like we used to
Pistols drawn, screaming "liberty or death,"
Although I think we wanted both somehow
But we'll take the cash instead

Stack it high, my friend
Until it reaches to the sky
And us and god can call it even
And look each other in the eyes
Like you did to the county prosecutor
Told him that you were the shooter
But they'd never take you alive
Grabbed his pen, and stabbed him in the eye
Ran off never to be seen again

When they strike, hit back harder
If you can't just hit back meaner
Everybody's got a name, and an address
And fragile bones to protect what's beating in their chest
Lash out, and vanish into mist
Gumshoes can take one in the head
Same to anyone who's ever seen a cop
And didn't bludgeon them to death
Same to anyone who's ever had a job
And didn't hang their fucking boss off the roof at the post office

So come on, let's take a ride like we used to
Daggers drawn, screaming "liberty or death,"
Although I think we wanted both somehow
Came in this world a loaded handgun
I'll leave it empty, or not at all

I curse the world one second
Demand it buy me a sandwich in the next
Or else I'm bumming the cigarettes
To help me to forget how hungry I am

I can't believe that bastard
Won this morning
It's the kind of night for vodka and forties

And we're mixing our drinks stiff tonight
And we're mixing our drinks stiff tonight

Today's the dawn of the draft
And tomorrow we're shipped off to Iraq
Or else we're cutting off a toe
Praying that we don't have to go

I can't believe that bastard
Won this morning
It's the kind of night for vodka and forties

Who's ready for the war tonight?
Who's ready for the war tonight?

I'm running on caffeine
And nicotine and amphetamines
I hope more stimulants are on the way
Cause who doesn't have a drug problem these days?

I can't believe that bastard
Won this morning
It's the kind of night for vodka and forties

And I'm sniffing those pills hard tonight
And I'm sniffing those pills hard tonight


Well, just 'cause I drink don't mean I don't hate stupid drunks
But just 'cause I'm singing it
That don't mean shit
That don't mean that I'm not one

But those jerks by the kegs
They aren't leaving me no ground to stand
So if we're picking sides
I guess that I hate the policeman
And the white man tonight

And well, I've been thinking things
Thinking things that I just hope aren't true
Like maybe you don't choose punk rock
Because punk rock chooses you

You know, I've seen the same bands
So many dozens of times
But with dozens of different names
Across dozens of different state lines
And I won't always admit it, but I think
That the world's better off with them in it

And so if we're picking sides
I guess that I am
For every shitty, three-chord, high school punk band
Oh yes I am
Oh yes I am

I took the needle out of my arm about
A year ago today
And every day since then I’ve been taking
The needle out of my brain
So when I’m staring down at my hands I can’t explain
Just what it is that I’m thinking of
Except thank god that all my veins have to pump is my blood

I’ve done you so much wrong I can’t believe
You would still talk to me
And I say so much bullshit I can’t believe
That anyone around me can breathe
I know that it’s a little dramatic
But the word for not changing is “death”
So I’m getting better, my friends, but please don’t hold your breath

I met a man in rehab the first time
An organizer in prison
He lived in Chicago when the cops shot Fred Hampton
But he was just a kid back then
Justice doesn’t flow from police guns
I’m reminded of that all the time
As long as there is a law, peace will be a crime

What the news calls economics
I still call it violence
If your god is a judge or a jailer
I’m still an atheist
But I try to have faith in the things that will happen;
I get saved from myself when I do
So maybe “God” isn’t the right word, but I believe in you

On Mondays, I do the laundry at a twenty four hour place next to the Dollar Tree
I know that I could walk, but god I love to drive
I thought about calling and asking forgiveness
But hell, I'm afraid of the dogs that I live with
I guess you take it one thing at a time

I thought about Jesse on Tuesday morning;
Last I heard, he was still doped up in Portland
I could call and ask, but hell, I know he'd lie
Like my neighbor, he's got business
If you don't know about it, better keep your distance
Ain't no one on this street ever called a cop in their life

On Wednesday, ran into Connor
Drinking like he was already a goner
He said he'd like to change if he could grow a spine
I said: "When you talk like that, it makes me real nervous
No, don't be inviting me to your funeral service
Throw down your fucking chips, let's play for keeps this time."

Like on Thursday when you called and woke me up
I heard you started smoking crack again and got caught up
Catching cases, robbing houses, just to stay alive
So I hung up, I called Vanessa
And I told them that I left the rent on the dresser
It wasn't even half of three weeks late this time


On Fridays, I do the laundry
At the twenty-four hour place next to the Dollar Tree
Past the neighbors reaching heaven with their trucks so high
I thought about calling and asking forgiveness
But lately I don't even know what that word is
I've got police on my six, because they think it's a crime

I got sober like a man drowning
Like a fish breathing, like Dracula sunbathing
In a place where the ground itself will stab you
The land itself will cut you
It will kill you if it's able
I arrived so certain I was ready
But nowadays I think there is no hurry
To return to the anarchism of the worms
Without god or master there
Six feet underneath the earth
The anarchy of dirt

I keep living like a crosswire
Like sabotage, like a lock glued shut
The ones like us seek each other like a brick finds glass
Like a fascist meets a grave, like sharks to blood
We gather what we can of shattered selves and face each other
I'll let the darkness speak for me when my bones don't listen
'Til I return to the communism of the worms
Without god or master there
Six feet underneath the earth
The commune of the dirt

I sleep at night like a flaming tire
Like city traffic blocks, like bottles at the police
I wake up and tell myself "live like you mean it!"
I don't know the stakes I play but they're worth everything to me
And I know that you're always tired comrade
Just hold on a bit longer and I promise that we'll sleep
When we return to the anarchism of the worms
Without god or master there
Six feet underneath the earth

The anarchy of dirt
The commune of the dirt

We'll dig up concrete to plant vegetables across the street
Neighbors and tweakers passing by will stop for something to eat
We'll set up milk crates as a free box
Then we'll get arrested by the cops
And if we fight back then we'll get beaten
And arrested on felony charges by the fucking cops

We'll lock down to gates and buses, we'll block off the streets
Because nothing else has worked to stop those fuckers in BP (Border Patrol)
We'll clog up the system, we'll grind Streamline to a stop
Then we'll get arrested by the cops
And if we fight back then we'll get beaten
And arrested on felony charges by the fucking cops

Seize entire cities, yeah, whole regions of a country
Abolish all police, religion, private property
We've done it before; united, we cannot be stopped!!
Then we'll all get lined up and shot by fascists
Or just Communists and liberals
Who've been waiting all along to become the fascist cops
